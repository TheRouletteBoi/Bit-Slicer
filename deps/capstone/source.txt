Config: Use Xcode project, set macOS deployment target to 11.5, add evm.h to Xcode project (stray reference that wasn't added in capstone/include/; there may be many more, and these need to be added to public headers too). Alter preprocessor macros to only build for arm64 on framework target (CAPSTONE_HAS_ARM64=1). Modify scheme to build for Release.
